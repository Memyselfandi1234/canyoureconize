<p>
I made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement, and I donʼt expect to be forgiven. Iʼm simply here to apologise.
What we came across in the woods that day was obviously unplanned. The reactions you saw on tape were raw; they were unfiltered. None of us knew how to react or how to feel. I should have never posted the video. I should have put the cameras down and stopped recording what we were going through.
There's a lot of things I should have done differently but I didn't. And for that, from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry.
I want to apologise to the internet. I want to apologise to anyone who has seen the video. I want to apologise to anyone who has been affected or touched by mental illness, or depression, or suicide. But most importantly I want to apologise to the victim and his family.
For my fans who are defending my actions, please don't. I donʼt deserve to be defended. My goal with my content is always to entertain; to push the boundaries, to be all-inclusive. In the world live in, I share almost everything I do. The intent is never to be heartless, cruel, or malicious.
Like I said I made a huge mistake. I donʼt expect to be forgiven, Iʼm just here to apologise.
Im ashamed of myself. Iʼm disappointed in myself. And I promise to be better. I will be better. Thank you.
